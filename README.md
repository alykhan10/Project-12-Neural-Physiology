# Project #13: Projection Imaging
# Identifying Viral Lung Infection from X-Ray Scans Using Machine Learning

● Conducted literature review to outline state-of-the-art methods for diagnosing lung infection using radiography         
● Extracted chest x-ray scans into 3D Slicer software from a randomized trial with 2 control and infected test subjects          
● Characterized differences for normal and viral lungs via the Sobel edge-detection filter and histograms in MATLAB
