# Project #12: Neural Physiology
# Configuring an Electroneurogram for Early Detection of Multiple Sclerosis 

● Utilized electroneurogram (ENG) as a minimally-invasive technique for sensory and motor stimulation of the vagus nerve                 
● Designed proof-of-concept with 2 cuff electrodes to measure change in latency times from action potential of nerve bundles                
● Identified beamforming as a spatial filter for isolation of impulses to amplify signal-to-noise ratio and reduce axonal crosstalk
